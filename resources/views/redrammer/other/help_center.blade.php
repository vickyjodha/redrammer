            <h6>To create an redrammer account from the web:</h6>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to the <a href="redrammer.com">redrammer.com</a></li>
                <li>Click Sign up, enter your email address and create a password.</li>
            </ol>
            If you sign up with email, make sure you enter your email address correctly and choose an email address that only you can access. If you log out and forget your password, you'll need to be able to access your email to get back into your redrammer account.

                I can't sign up for an redrammer account because an account with my email address or phone number already exists.
            </h5>
            If you signed up for redrammer with your email address or phone number but you can't remember your password, you can reset your password and log into your account.
            <br>
            Keep in mind that an email address can only be associated with one Instagram account.
